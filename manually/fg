## 🔗 Step 4: Configure Nova to Use Neutron

Neutron integrates with Nova to manage network interfaces for VMs.

Edit Nova's config file:

```bash
sudo vi /etc/nova/nova.conf
```

### In the `[neutron]` section:

```ini
[neutron]
auth_url = http://controller:5000
auth_type = password
project_domain_name = Default
user_domain_name = Default
region_name = RegionOne
project_name = service
username = neutron
password = ubuntu
```

🔁 Replace `ubuntu` with the password you set for the `neutron` user in Keystone.

> ❗ If the `[neutron]` section doesn’t exist, create it.
